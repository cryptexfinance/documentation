The TCAP (Total Market Cap) Perpetual Futures Contract is a unique derivative that tracks the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization, allowing traders to gain exposure to the broader crypto market in a single position.

### construction
TCAP is constructed using Chainlink oracles, which aggregate data across the entire cryptocurrency market to calculate the total market capitalization. This data is then securely written on-chain, ensuring reliable and up-to-date information for the contract.

The Perpetual Futures protocol utilizes these oracle updates to settle trades, ensuring that the contract price accurately reflects the current state of the cryptocurrency market. Each time the Chainlink oracle updates the total market cap, the protocol automatically adjusts to maintain accurate pricing, providing traders with a seamless experience.
