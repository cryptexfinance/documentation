**Note: MEEM Perp is not yet Live**

The MEEM Perp is a perpetual futures contract based on an index composed of 5 meme tokens: DOGE, PEPE, FLOKI, SHIB, and ETH. Each token in the index is equally weighted, with a weight of 20%.

#### Construction

The closing prices of each token on 07/02/2024 were recorded as the mark prices. The index price is calculated using the following formula:
```
    MEEM Index Price = 0.2 * (Current DOGE Price / DOGE Mark Price) + 0.2 * (Current SHIB Price / SHIB Mark Price) + 0.2 * (Current PEPE Price / PEPE Mark Price) + 0.2 * (Current FLOKI Price / DOGE Mark Price) + 0.2 * (Current FLOKI Price / DOGE ETH Price) 
```
