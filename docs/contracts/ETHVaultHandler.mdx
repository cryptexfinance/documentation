Extends [IVaultHandler](/contracts/ivaulthandler) allowing the use of ETH and WETH as collateral on the same contract.

## Code

[ETHVaultHandler.sol](https://github.com/cryptexglobal/contracts/blob/master/contracts/ETHVaultHandler.sol)

## Address

TBD

## State-Changing Functions

### constructor

```sol
constructor(Orchestrator _orchestrator) public;
```

Called once the contract it's deployed, sets the orchestrator as owner. It also sets the vault counter to 1 as 0 is reserved for empty objects.

### addCollateralETH

```sol
function addCollateralETH()
  public
  payable
  nonReentrant
  vaultExists
  whenNotPaused;
```

Adds collateral to vault using ETH. `msg.value` should be higher than 0.

### removeCollateralETH

```sol
function removeCollateralETH(uint256 _amount)
  public
  nonReentrant
  vaultExists
  whenNotPaused;
```

Removes not used collateral from collateral. `_amout` should be higher than 0.

### safeTransferETH

```sol
function safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value)internal;
```

Allows the safe transfer of ETH.

### receive

```sol
receive() external payable;
```

Only accept ETH via fallback from the WETH contract.
