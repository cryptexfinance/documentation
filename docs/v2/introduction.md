Cryptex Finance V2 is a DeFi protocol that makes crypto native markets tradable.
The protocol uses Ethereum smart contracts, Perennial derivatives vaults, and Chainlink data oracles to provide secure and decentralized trading for users on the Arbitrum Network.

Cryptex Finance is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO),
governed by holders of CTX tokens.
CTX was created through a fair launch to promote transparent, community-based governance.
CTX holders can vote on proposals, upgrades, and treasury management.
