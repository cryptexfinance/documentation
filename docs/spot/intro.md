Spot is a multi-chain liquidity aggregation dApp that supports any-2-any swaps by aggregating bridges and DEX aggregators across +20 networks.

The dapp is built on top of [lifi](https://docs.li.fi/). As a bridge and DEX aggregator, the dapp can route any asset on any chain to the desired asset on the desired chain, thus providing a remarkable UX to their users.
