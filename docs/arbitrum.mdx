Cryptex has the ability to deploy index tokens on the Arbitrum network.
The governance, however, remains on the Ethereum maninnet. 
Cryptex has built a bridge to relay governance proposals from the Ethereum mainnet to the Arbitrum Network.

### Bridge Architecture

#### Arbitrum Message Relayer

This contract takes proposals from the timelock contract and 
encodes data in a way that is accepted by Arbitrum's delayed inbox contract.
Arbitrum's delayed inbox then relays the calldata to the arbitrum network. 

#### Arbitrum Message Executor
This contract executes calldata received from Arbitrum Message Relayer and executes them.
