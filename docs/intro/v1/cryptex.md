Cryptex Finance is a multi-network DeFi protocol that provides Crypto and 
NFT users easy access to fully-decentralized index tokens. 
The protocol uses Ethereum smart contracts, over-collateralized vaults, and Chainlink data oracles to create indexes for users around the world in a trustless way.



Cryptex Finance is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), 
governed by holders of CTX tokens. 
CTX was created through a fair launch to promote transparent, community-based governance. 
CTX holders can vote on proposals, upgrades, and treasury management.
