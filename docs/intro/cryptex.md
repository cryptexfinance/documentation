Cryptex is focused on building innovative, open source financial products for the global Crypto community.
Using Ethereumâ€™s smart contract system, Cryptex is able to build decentralized financial synthetic instruments such as [Total Market Cap Token](/tcap), [JPEGZ](/jpegz) and many others. 
With real world data on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) blockchain along with collateralized backings for generating tokens, these products were previously not possible without a centralized custodian or manager. 
Now, Cryptex is providing the framework for decentralized financial products that offer exposure to more than just BTC, ETH, and other DeFi tokens.
 
In the world of decentralized financial products, accessing global data on the blockchain is one of the more difficult problems. 
Chainlink enables Cryptex to aggregate multiple data points from external sources within the smart contract framework on Ethereum. 
Using a trust minimized oracle framework allows TCAP to minimize trust of Cryptex and ultimately serve as a better trustless financial product.
