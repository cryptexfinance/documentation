For cryptocurrency investors, traders, funds, DeFi users, and institutions, TCAP is an ERC-20 compatible smart contract that tokenizes real-time Total Market Capitalization from all cryptocurrencies and tokens listed on the most reputable crypto data providers in the world.

Combining blockchain technology with the process of data aggregation, over $1 trillion of raw market capitalization data can be brought to market via crosscollateralized, asset nominal tokenization. Asset nominal tokenization starts with the process of taking a data metric, such as Total Market Capitalization. This metric is then set to a divisor of 10,000,000,000. The new, nominal asset token value now trades in lockstep with the underlying data metric it tracks.

Collateralizing the new smart contract against multiple assets like ETH or DAI provides the security that this new tokenized asset is backed by a set of rules and collateral enforced by an Ethereum smart contract, thereby tokenizing total market capitalization.

For example, if the total crypto market cap resides at 350 billion dollars. We then add a divisor to that number, just like the S&P 500 or any major financial index would. The price calculation for TCAP is as follows:

$c$ = \$350,000,000,000

$d$ = 10,000,000,000

$r$ = $\frac{c}{d}$ = \$35.00

Where $c$ is the total cryptocurrency market cap, $d$ is the divisor and $r$ is the TCAP token price.

TCAPs are then minted upon being collateralized by an underlying asset, such as ETH or DAI. 
What the user receives in return is a newly minted asset nominalized token that moves in real time to the penny of the underlying total market cap metric our [TCAP Smart Contract](contracts/tcap) is tracking. 
Each TCAP is algorithmically collateralized by a corresponding amount of ETH or DAI needed to appropriately back each token by 150%, thus creating price exposure to the entire cryptocurrency sector with the single push of a button.

TCAP is currently deployment on Ethereum mainnet.

#### Types of Vaults

TCAP has two kinds of vaults, low-risk vaults and high-risk vaults. The low-risk vaults are called Regular vaults, and the high-risk vaults are called hard-mode vaults. The regular vaults have a collateralization ratio between 150-200%, and a liquidation penalty is 10 %. The hard-mode vaults have a collateralization ratio of 125% and a liquidation ratio of 19%.
The hard-modes vaults allow minting with more capital efficiency because of low vault ratios, but they penalize very heavily during liquidations

#### Supported Collaterals

The regular vaults support ETH, DAI, WBTC, AAVE and LINK as collaterals. The hard-mode vaults support ETH and DAI as collaterals.

#### Minimum Vault Ratio

All hard-mode vaults have a minimum vault ratio requirement of 125%. All regular vaults have a minimum vault ratio requirement of 200%, except ETH, which has a  requirement of 150%. 

#### Liquidation Penalty

TCAP regular vaults have a liquidation penalty of 10 % and the hard-mode vaults have a liquidation penalty of 19%.   

#### Fees

TCAP regular vaults have a burn fee of 1 % and the hard-mode vaults 0f 0.05%. The fee is charged as a percentage of the amount minted in ETH. The DAO owns the revenue generated through these fees.
