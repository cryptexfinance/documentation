TCAP is the World's First Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization Token created by [Cryptex Finance](https://app.cryptex.finance). Like a conventional index fund, TCAP gives holders a real-time price exposure to the total cryptocurrency market cap. TCAP is not a fixed basket of tokens, an ICO, nor a rebased elastic. It's a new, 150% fully backed, fully collateralized asset thatâ€™s both audited and accurately representative of the entire cryptocurrency complex by total market capitalization.

The TCAP smart contracts are powered by [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) decentralized oracles that blend real time total market cap crypto data from seven of the most reputable crypto data providers in the world, subsequently bringing said data on chain to our TCAP smart contract.

For example, as of this writing, total crypto market cap currently resides at 350 billion dollars. We then add a divisor to that number, just like the S&P 500 or any major financial index would. The price calculation for TCAP is as follows:

$c$ = \$350,000,000,000

$d$ = 10,000,000,000

$r$ = $\frac{c}{d}$ = \$35.00

Where $c$ is the total cryptocurrency market cap, $d$ is the divisor and $r$ is the TCAP token price.

TCAPs are then minted upon being collateralized by an underlying asset, such as ETH, WBTC or DAI. What the user receives in return is a newly minted asset nominalized token that moves in real time to the penny of the underlying total market cap metric our [TCAP Smart Contract](contracts/tcap) is tracking. Each TCAP is algorithmically collateralized by a corresponding amount of ETH/ WBTC or DAI needed to appropriately back each token by 150%, thus creating price exposure to the entire cryptocurrency sector with the single push of a button.

## Components

TCAP architecture has the following components:

<img alt="TCAP Components" src={useBaseUrl("img/CTX.png")} />

### Governance

#### CTX

ERC-20 Token in charge of the Governance of the Protocol. Owners of the CTX Token are able to make proposals and vote to make protocol changes. Read more details on the [CTX Reference](governance/reference#read-only-functions-ctx).

#### Governor Alpha

This contract is in charge of managing proposals and actions, CTX holders call it to vote or create new proposals with actions that will be queued into the Timelock if the voting is successful. Read more details on the
[Governor Alpha Reference](reference#read-only-functions-governor-alpha)

#### Timelock

The Timelock contract can modify system parameters, logic, and contracts in a 'time-delayed, opt-out' upgrade pattern. Read more details on the [Timelock Reference](governance/reference#timelock)

#### Orchestrator

The Orchestrator acts as the owner of other TCAP Protocol Components. The Orchestrator functions can only be called by it's owner, the Timelock Contract controlled by CTX Governance. Read more details on the [Orchestrator Contract](contracts/orchestrator).

#### Treasury

Contract that handles the finances of the Protocol.

### Vaults

#### Vault Handler

The Vault handler is in charge of managing user vaults. Vaults allow users to stake a collateral to mint new TCAP Tokens. Only one vault per address can be generated in a Vault Handler. Each Vault Handler is connected to a TCAP Token, three Chainlink Oracle (TCAP Oracle, Collateral Oracle and an ETH Price Oracle) a Treasury Contract and a CTX Reward Distributor. Parameters are handled by the Orchestrator. Read more details on the [Vault Handler Contract](contracts/ivaulthandler).

#### TCAP Token

The TCAP Token is an ERC20 compliant contract which can only be minted and burned by a Vault Handler. It behaves like a normal ERC20 Token with a cap parameter handled by the Orchestrator. Read more details on the [TCAP Token Contract](contracts/tcap).

### Oracles

#### Chainlink Oracle

The Chainlink Oracle is a custom contract that connects to a Chainlink Oracles through an Aggregator. This allow the VaultHandler to read information from Chainlink on real time. Read more details on the [Chainlink Oracle Contract](contracts/chainlink).

#### Chainlink Aggregator

Chainlink Aggregators are contracts created by Chainlink that allow TCAP contracts to connect with decentralized oracles on real time. Read more details on [Chainlink Aggregators](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-the-latest-price).

### Rewards

#### Reward Handler

The Reward Handler is in charge of the initial distribution of CTX for the first week of the Protocol launch, this early distribution will help bootstrap the governance to the community using the Cryptex Protocol. Read more details on [Reward Handler Contract](contracts/rewardhandler).

#### Liquidity Reward

The Reward Handler is in charge of handling CTX rewards for liquidity providers on the Sushiswap Protocol, rewards will help decentralize CTX as well as promoto liquidity of the TCAP token. Read more details on [Reward Handler Contract](contracts/rewardhandler).
