### How is TCAP pegged to the price of total crypto market cap?

TCAP uses Chainlink oracles which enables Cryptex to aggregate multiple data points from seven of the top crypto data providers in the world and brings that data on chain using Ethereum smart contract.
Using a trust minimized oracle framework allows TCAP to minimize trust of Cryptex and ultimately enables us to create better trustless financial products.

### What is TCAP backed by?

Each TCAP is collateralized by more than 150% corresponding amount of ETH, WBTC or DAI.
TCAP includes EVERY coin and token?
TCAP includes every coin and token supported in one of our seven crypto data providers.

### Is TCAP decentralized?

TCAP uses Admin Keys to pause deposits and minting in case of a bug to protect users, also uses the key to change state variables, we are securing this process by adding a timelock of three days, allowing users to see which value is going to change ahead of time. We expect to further decentralize TCAP as time goes on.

### Is TCAP live yet?

TCAP is currently live on Rinkeby Testnet, you can try TCAP going to [app.cryptex.finance](https://app.cryptex.finace)

### Who is TCAP for?

TCAP is for users that want to speculate in the total crypto currency market by buying a token that it’s the representation of the market. It’s also for DeFi users that want to earn fees by minting TCAP tokens and adding liquidity on decentralized exchanges or taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.
