There are three types of fees that a product can charge: maker, taker, and funding.

Maker fee is the fee % on the notional maker volume opened or closed.

Taker fee is the fee % on the notional taker volume opened or closed.

Funding fee is a fee % on the magnitude of the funding rate.

Maker and Taker fees are completely optional, however Perennial has a protocol minimum funding fee parameter that can be updated.

### Fee Split
All collected fees are split between the Makers (and in rare cases takers), Perennial treasury, and the respective Product owner's treasury.

This allows Product owners (whether individual organization or DAOs / protocols) to collect revenue directly from the administration of the Products and their parameters.
