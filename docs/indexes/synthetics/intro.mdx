Synthetics is a decentralized protocol designed to tokenize the price of an underlying index using an ERC20 token. It functions as a market index, leveraging an oracle to accurately track the price of the underlying index.

A prime example of a synthetic token is the Total Market Cap token (TCAP), which tracks the price of the entire cryptocurrency market.

### Collateralization and Token Minting
Synthetics are backed by collateral such as ETH or DAI. When users interact with the protocol, they receive newly minted nominalized tokens that reflect the real-time price movement of the underlying index. Each synthetic token is algorithmically collateralized by a corresponding amount of ETH or DAI, ensuring sufficient backing for each token. This mechanism allows users to gain price exposure to the underlying index with a single action.
