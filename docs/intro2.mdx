TCAP is the World's First Total Cryptocurrency Market Capitalization created by [Cryptex Finance](https://cryptex.finance). Like a conventional index fund, TCAP gives holders a real-time price exposure to the total cryptocurrency market cap. TCAP is not a fixed basket of tokens. TCAP is not an ICO, nor a rebased elastic. TCAP is a new, 150% fully backed, fully collateralized asset thatâ€™s both audited and accurately representative of the entire cryptocurrency complex by total market capitalization.

TCAP is powered by decentralized [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) oracles that blend real time total market cap crypto data from seven of the most reputable crypto data providers in the world, subsequently bringing said data on chain to our TCAP smart contract. For example, as of this writing, total crypto market cap currently resides at 350 billion dollars. We then add a divisor to that number, just like the S&P 500 or any major
financial index would.

The price calculation for TCAP is as follows:

$c$ = \$350,000,000,000

$d$ = 10,000,000,000

$r$ = $\frac{c}{d}$ = \$35.00

Where $c$ is the total cryptocurrency market cap, $d$ is the divisor and $r$ is the TCAP token price.

TCAPs are then minted upon being collateralized by an underlying asset, such as ETH, WBTC or DAI. What the user receives in return is a newly minted asset nominalized token that moves in real time to the penny of the underlying total market cap metric our [TCAP Smart Contract](#TODO) is tracking. Each TCAP is algorithmically collateralized by a corresponding amount of ETH/ WBTC or DAI needed to appropriately back each token by 150%, thus creating price exposure to the entire cryptocurrency sector with the single push of a button.

## Components

**Total Market Cap Price Oracle Contract**. The smart contract that will store the actualized
price feed of the total market value provided by Nomics Private Key. The TCAP proxy
contract will use these values.

**ETH/USD Price Oracle Contract**. Minting TCAP requires a collateralization of ETH, this oracle provides a feed for the current price of ETH/USD. Right now Chainlink Oracle is implemented.

**ERC20 Token Contract**. ERC20 Compliant contract that will be in charge of handling the TCAP token logic.
